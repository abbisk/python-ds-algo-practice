# Arithmetic Progression
# You are given first three entries of an arithmetic progression. You have to calculate the common difference and print it.


# Input format:
# The first line of input contains an integer a (1 <= a <= 100)
# The second line of input contains an integer b (1 <= b <= 100)
# The third line of input contains an integer c (1 <= c <= 100)

# Constraints:
# Time Limit: 1 second

# Output format:
# The first and only line of output contains the result.

# Sample Input:
# 1
# 3
# 5
# Sample Output:
# 4
# 2

a= int(input("Enter a: "))
b= int(input("Enter b: "))
c= int(input("Enter c: "))

print("Sum of a and b = ", a+b)
print("Sum of a+b+c = 2",b-a)
